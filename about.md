Hi there! My name is Shanasia Sylman (Sha-nay-Sha Sil-man), and I am currently pursuing my PhD in City and Regional Planning at Cornell University. I anticipate finishing my dissertation in the Spring of 2027. I am also a 2024-2026 NOAA Margaret A. Davidson Graduate Research Fellow at the [Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve (TRNERR)](https://tijuanaestuary.org/). 

My research broadly focuses on how to address place-based harms within parks and protected areas. [*More description to come!*] 

Prior to getting my PhD, I worked as an outdoor recreation planner for the National Park Service from 2018 to 2022. 

When I am not reading, writing and researchin', I'm enjoying sitcoms, documentaries, news or horror movies. I aspire to get my yoga and mindfulness practices more consistent, and am always looking for new recipes to try.
